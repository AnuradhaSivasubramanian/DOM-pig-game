---

DOM Pig game is a dice rolling game built using Vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS. 
Player can set a final winning score and start the game. Each player gets to keep rolling the dice until they get a 1. Pressing the hold button lets the player add the current score to the total score, losing his turn to role the dice. If the player rolls a 1 before clicking on hold, he/she loses the current score completely. Player who reaches the final score first is the winner.
